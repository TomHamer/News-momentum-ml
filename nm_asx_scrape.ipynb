The Exterra Board believes that the combination of Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Big Springs Project in Nevada, USA \\nand strong balance sheet with Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s near term production Second Fortune Gold Mine in Western \\nAustralia (part of the Linden Gold Project) and surrounding exploration projects, is compelling for \\nshareholders of both companies. \\n\\nYour Directors consider the Merger to be in the best interests of Exterra Shareholders and have \\nunanimously recommended that Exterra Shareholders vote in favour of the Merger, in the absence of \\na Superior Proposal. \\n\\nIn forming their unanimous recommendation, your Directors have concluded that the Merger will \\nprovide a number of significant benefits to Exterra Shareholders, including the following: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nthe Merged Group will have a strong balance sheet with which to fast track production at \\nExterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Second Fortune Gold Mine; \\n\\nthe Merged Group will be larger and more diversified than Exterra, with two near term gold \\nproducing projects and a portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, located in \\nWestern Australia and Nevada, USA; \\n\\nthe Scheme Consideration represents a significant premium to historical trading prices of \\nExterra Shares; \\n\\nthe Merged Group is expected to have an enhanced market presence and greater liquidity \\nthan that currently enjoyed by Exterra Shareholders; \\n\\nthe combined Board and management team of the Merged Group will have the skills and \\ncapacity to advance the production and development projects in parallel with exploration and \\nconsolidation activities; and \\n\\nthe Merged Group will be better placed to pursue further consolidation opportunities, with \\nimproved chances of success.  \\n\\nThis Scheme Booklet sets out your Directors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 views on the key advantages and disadvantages of the \\nproposed Merger, and addresses a range of other considerations and questions you may have as an \\nExterra Shareholder.  \\n\\nIn considering the Merger, you should be aware that the Independent Expert, BDO Corporate Finance \\n(WA) Pty Ltd, has formed the opinion that in the absence of a superior proposal, the Merger is fair and \\nreasonable and therefore in the best interests of Exterra Shareholders. The full report of the \\nIndependent Expert is set out in Annexure A.  \\n\\nI encourage you to read this Scheme Booklet (including the report of the Independent Expert) carefully \\nin full, and if required, to seek your own legal, financial or other professional advice.  \\n\\n \\n\\npage 3 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\nYour vote is important regardless of how many Exterra Shares you own.

The Merged Group is expected to benefit from the application of Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knowledge of ore \\nsorting technology to the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s projects as well as the consolidation of corporate overheads \\nand exploration activities. The Merged Group should also be well positioned to achieve further growth \\nby participating in logical future industry consolidation and rationalisation.  \\n\\nAs an Exterra Shareholder, your vote is important in order to ensure that the Merger is implemented \\nso that the benefits flowing from the Merger can be delivered to both sets of shareholders.  \\n\\nI am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for the Merged Group and believe that the Merger \\nwill unlock significant long-term value for shareholders of both companies.  \\n\\nOn behalf of the Anova Board, I encourage you to vote in favour of the Scheme and look forward to \\nwelcoming you as a shareholder of Anova following the successful implementation of the Merger. \\n\\nYours sincerely, \\n\\n \\nMalcolm James \\n \\n\\nNon-Executive Chairman \\nAnova Metals Limited \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 5 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nAction required by Exterra Shareholders \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n \\n\\nYour vote is important \\nEvery Exterra Shareholder is urged to vote, regardless of the size of your \\nshareholding. \\nFor the Scheme to proceed, it is necessary that sufficient Exterra Shareholders vote in \\nfavour of the Scheme.

As Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market \\ncapitalisation was only approximately $13 million immediately prior to the announcement of \\nthe Scheme1, the funding requirements and risks associated with the development of the \\nSecond Fortune Gold Mine are considered to be significant were Exterra to proceed with the \\ndevelopment of that mine on a stand-alone basis.  \\n\\nAs at 31 May 2017, Anova had approximately $7.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and \\nno debt. Further, Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market capitalisation was approximately $56.7 million immediately \\nprior to the announcement of the Scheme.2  \\n\\nThe combination of Exterra with Anova will create a Merged Group that has a strong balance \\nsheet with pro forma cash as at 31 May 2017 of approximately $9.7 million and no debt. \\nTogether with the greater scale and diversity of the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operations, this is \\nexpected to result in: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nan increased ability to fast track production at the Second Fortune Gold Mine as \\nwell as pursue the growth of the balance of the asset portfolio; and \\n\\nan enhanced ability to source equity and debt funding on more favourable terms \\nthan would currently be available to Exterra. \\n\\n                                                      \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n1   Based on the closing price of Exterra Shares and Anova Shares on 5 June 2016 (being the last trading day prior to the \\n\\nannouncement of the Scheme. \\n\\n2   See note 1 above. \\n\\n \\n\\npage 9 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\nIn connection with the Scheme, Anova has made available to Exterra a $2 million loan facility \\nso as to provide Exterra with access to necessary funding to continue to progress the \\ndevelopment of the Second Fortune Gold Mine whilst the Scheme is being implemented. \\nFurther information on the loan provided to Exterra by Anova is set out in Sections 4.4(d) \\nand 10.6(a) of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nThe Independent Expert has concluded that in the absence of a superior \\nproposal, the Scheme is fair and reasonable and therefore is in the best \\ninterests of Exterra Shareholders \\nThe Independent Expert, BDO Corporate Finance (WA) Pty Ltd, has concluded that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe \\nScheme is fair and reasonable and therefore is in the best interests of Exterra Shareholders, \\nin the absence of a Superior Proposal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.   \\n\\nThe Independent Expert has assessed the value of two Exterra Shares, inclusive of the \\npremium for control, as being between $0.078 and $0.142, which compares with the \\nIndependent Expert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assessment of the value of the Scheme Consideration of between \\n$0.089 and $0.152 per Exterra Share (based on the sum-of-parts method, as the primary \\nvaluation method, and quoted market price basis as the secondary method). \\n\\nThe Independent Expert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Report is contained in Annexure A to this Scheme Booklet, and \\nExterra Shareholders are encouraged to read the report in full. \\n\\nThe Merged Group will be larger and more diversified than Exterra, with two \\nnear term gold producing projects and a portfolio of exploration and \\ndevelopment opportunities in Western Australia and Nevada, USA  \\nThe Merger of Anova and Exterra will create a larger growth focussed ASX-listed gold \\ncompany, with a pipeline of gold projects at various stages of development in Western \\nAustralia and the United States of America. \\n\\nThe Merged Group will have two near-term production projects in two different jurisdictions, \\nbeing:    \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nExterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Second Fortune Gold Mine (part of the Linden Gold Project) located in \\nLinden, Western Australia, which is expected to move into production in the first \\nquarter of 2018; and \\n\\nAnova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Big Springs Project located in Nevada, USA, which has received all \\npermits necessary to commence production on the 601 and 701 ore bodies, \\nfollowing lodgement of a reclamation bond. \\n\\nIn particular, the Merger will result in Exterra Shareholders obtaining an interest in the \\ndiversity of opportunities associated with the development of Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Big Springs Project in \\nNevada, USA, with near term production expected from an open pit mine with the potential \\nfor a staged progression into underground mining operations. \\n\\nThe Merged Group will also have a portfolio of exploration assets, including Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Zelica \\nGold Project and Malcolm Gold Project (both with existing Mineral Resources) as well as \\nexploration prospects in the Linden Gold Project (surrounding the Second Fortune Gold \\nMine) and Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s North Sammy, South Sammy and Beadles Creek prospects. The Merged \\nGroup\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portfolio will cover a broad range of prospects, from extension of existing Mineral \\nResources to regional exploration work, which is expected to provide the Merged Group with \\nstrong growth potential. \\n\\nThe Exterra Directors believe that the Merged Group will benefit from an improved risk \\nprofile resulting from the increased breadth of the asset portfolio with greater operational and \\n\\n \\n\\npage 10 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n(d) \\n\\n(e) \\n\\ngeographic diversification. Exterra Shareholders will collectively hold approximately 27.6% of \\nthe Merged Group immediately following the successful implementation of the Scheme. 3 \\n\\nThe Scheme Consideration represents a significant premium to historical \\ntrading prices of Exterra Shares \\nIf the Scheme is implemented, eligible Exterra Shareholders will receive one Anova Share \\nfor every two Exterra Shares that they hold.4 \\n\\nThe Scheme Consideration to be issued to Exterra Shareholders if the Scheme becomes \\nEffective represents a substantial premium of approximately: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n64% to the closing price of Exterra Shares of $0.038 on ASX on the Pre-\\nAnnouncement Date;5 \\n\\n61% to the VWAP of Exterra Shares over the 5 trading days up to and including \\nthe Pre-Announcement Date, compared to the VWAP of Anova Shares over the \\nsame period; and \\n\\n52% to the VWAP of Exterra Shares over the 30 days up to and including the Pre-\\nAnnouncement Date, compared to the VWAP of Anova Shares over the same \\nperiod. \\n\\nAs at the Last Practicable Date, the last closing price of Exterra Shares on ASX was $0.040 \\nand the closing price of Anova Shares on ASX was $0.078, such that the Scheme \\nConsideration represents a discount of 2.5% to the closing price of Exterra Shares at that \\ntime. The implied price of the Scheme Consideration will continue to fluctuate depending \\nupon the price at which Anova Shares trade on ASX. \\n\\nThe Merged Group is expected to have an enhanced market presence and \\ngreater liquidity than that currently enjoyed by Exterra Shareholders  \\nIf the Merger proceeds, you will benefit by receiving shares in the Merged Group that are \\nexpected to be substantially more liquid than Exterra Shares on a stand-alone basis. In the \\n12 month period up until the Pre Announcement Date, the daily average value of Anova \\nShares traded on ASX was approximately 2.5 times greater than the daily average value of \\nExterra Shares traded over that period.  \\n\\nFurther, the Merged Group will have a pro forma market capitalisation of approximately $78 \\nmillion. 6 The Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strengthened balance sheet, increased asset suite, larger \\nresource base and increased market capitalisation is expected to raise the profile of the \\nMerged Group in capital markets and widen the range of potential investors for the Merged \\nGroup. This in turn is expected to result in increased coverage of the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\noperations by analysts and enhance the liquidity of shares in the Merged Group, and may be \\nexpected to assist in a positive re-rating of the Merged Group. \\n\\nExterra Shareholders may also benefit from the potential re-rating of Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets in the \\nMerged Group, as the funding risks associated with the development of the Second Fortune \\nGold Mine are likely to be reduced for the Merged Group as opposed to if Exterra sought to \\nprogress the development of that project on a stand-alone basis.  \\n\\nExterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share price has strengthened since the announcement of the Merger. The last \\nclosing price of Exterra Shares on the Last Practicable Date was $0.040, representing an \\nincrease of approximately 5.26% to the last closing price of Exterra Shares on the Pre-\\n\\n                                                      \\n\\n3   Assuming that there are no Ineligible Shareholders and that Anova does not acquire any additional Exterra Shares outside \\n\\nof the Scheme. \\n\\n4   Foreign Exterra Shareholders should refer to the Important Notices and Section 2.11 of the Scheme Booklet to determine \\n\\nwhether they are eligible to receive Anova Shares pursuant to the Scheme. \\n\\n5   Based on the closing price of Anova Shares of $0.125 on ASX on the Pre-Announcement Date. \\n6   Refer to section 6.1 of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 11 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n(f) \\n\\n(g) \\n\\nAnnouncement Date of $0.038.

The Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management team will also be strengthened by the \\nappointment of Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existing Executive Director Mr Laing to the role of Technical \\nDirector as a key member of Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s executive management team. Further information \\nregarding the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Board and management team is set out in Sections 6.4 and \\n6.5 of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nThe integration of the boards and management teams of Exterra and Anova is expected to \\nallow for a more effective allocation of resources to the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portfolio of \\nproduction, development and exploration assets, as well as the ability to apply Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nknowledge of ore sorting technology to the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s projects. It is also expected to \\nresult in the Merged Group having the capacity to develop production and development \\nassets at the same time as undertaking exploration and consolidation activities. In addition, \\nefficiencies should be realised as a result of consolidating the corporate and administrative \\noverheads of both companies. \\n\\nThe Merged Group will be better placed to pursue further consolidation \\nopportunities, with improved chances of success \\nThe Merged Group will have project portfolios in two gold mining jurisdictions, which can be \\nleveraged off to pursue a greater range of consolidation opportunities to further grow the \\nbusiness.  Importantly, the depth of the Board and management team of the Merged Group \\nprovides the capacity to investigate and execute potential consolidation opportunities in \\nparallel to the ongoing development of the existing asset portfolio.   \\n\\nThe increased scale and financial strength of the Merged Group is likely to improve its \\nchanges of successfully completing any such consolidation opportunities (should they arise) \\nthan Exterra would have if it was pursuing such opportunities on a stand-alone basis.  \\n\\n1.3 \\n\\nPotential disadvantages or risks associated with the Scheme \\nThe Scheme has a number of potential disadvantages and risks that Exterra Shareholders \\nshould consider in deciding whether or not to vote in favour of the Scheme. \\n\\nWhile the Exterra Board is of the opinion that these disadvantages and risks are outweighed \\nby the Scheme\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advantages, and that the Scheme is in the best interests of Exterra \\nShareholders in the absence of a Superior Proposal, Exterra Shareholders should consider \\ntheir individual circumstances in determining how to vote in relation to the Scheme. \\n\\nYou may disagree with the recommendations by the Independent Expert and \\nthe Exterra Directors \\nNotwithstanding the unanimous recommendation by the Exterra Directors, and the \\nconclusion reached by the Independent Expert that in the absence of a superior proposal, \\nthe Scheme is fair and reasonable to Exterra Shareholders and therefore in the best \\ninterests of Exterra Shareholders, you may believe that the Scheme is not in your best \\ninterests and believe that the Scheme Consideration is inadequate.  \\n\\npage 12 \\n\\n(a) \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nYour percentage interest in the Merged Group will be reduced relative to your \\ncurrent interest in Exterra \\nIf the Merger is implemented, Exterra Shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 combined equity interest in the assets of \\nExterra will reduce from 100% to approximately 27.6%. However, it is important that Exterra \\nShareholders appreciate that in the absence of the Merger:  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nthere is likely to be continued uncertainty regarding the funding of the development \\nof Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Second Fortune Gold Mine, with alternative potential financing options \\npresenting other challenges and risks for Exterra Shareholders;  \\n\\nthere may be delays in the planned schedule to produce gold from Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nSecond Fortune Gold Mine whilst the required funding is secured; and \\n\\nExterra Shareholders will not acquire a 27.6% equity interest in the assets of \\nAnova, which includes Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Big Springs Gold Project, in Nevada, USA, and so \\nwill not diversify their risk profile away from Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existing Western Australian \\nasset base. \\n\\nIf the Merger does not proceed, Exterra will also need to repay amounts drawn down under \\nthe loan facility provided by Anova, or otherwise seek to have those amounts converted into \\nExterra Shares. However, under the terms of the loan facility negotiated with Anova, the \\nobligation to repay amounts drawn down under that facility is not accelerated as a result of \\nthe failure of the proposed Merger, such that Exterra Directors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 believe that there should be \\nsufficient time in which to seek to refinance any such amounts.  \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nThe investment profile for Exterra Shareholders will change and you may \\nconsider the investment profile of the Merged Group to be inferior to that of \\nExterra as a stand-alone entity \\nThe operational and geographical profile, capital structure and size of the Merged Group will \\nbe different to that of Exterra on a stand-alone basis.   \\n\\nIt is possible that certain Exterra Shareholders may wish to maintain an interest in Exterra as \\na stand-alone entity because they are seeking an investment in a publicly listed company \\nwith the specific characteristics of Exterra.  The change in investment profile resulting from \\nthe Merger may be considered to be a disadvantage to such shareholders. \\n\\nIn addition, if the Scheme is implemented, there will be a change in the risk profile to which \\nExterra Shareholders are exposed. Exterra will merge its business with that of Anova and \\nExterra Shareholders will receive New Anova Shares.  As a consequence, Exterra \\nShareholders will be exposed to risk factors relating to Anova, and to certain additional risks \\nrelating to the Merged Group and the integration of the two companies.  These include risks \\nrelating to the operation of a broader suite of assets than Exterra currently holds.  In a \\nnumber of cases, those risks are different from or additional to those currently faced by \\nExterra Shareholders.  The change in risk profile may be seen to be a disadvantage by some \\nExterra Shareholders. \\n\\nSection 7 discusses the risk factors relating to Exterra, Anova and the Merged Group.  \\nExterra Shareholders are encouraged to read that section in its entirety.  It is also important \\nto note that certain risks will apply if the Scheme does not proceed.  These are also \\ndiscussed in Section 7. \\n\\nYou may consider that there is the potential for a Superior Proposal to be \\nmade to Exterra in the foreseeable future  \\nIt is possible that a Superior Proposal for Exterra may materialise in the future which is more \\nattractive for Exterra Shareholders than the Merger.  The implementation of the Merger \\nwould mean that Exterra Shareholders would not be able to obtain the benefit of any such \\nproposal. \\n\\nThe Exterra Board is not currently aware of any such proposal, nor are they aware of any \\nparty with an intention to make such a proposal. \\n\\npage 13 \\n\\n(d) \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n(e) \\n\\n(f) \\n\\n1.4 \\n\\n(a) \\n\\n \\n\\nExterra Shareholders should be aware that before proceeding with the Merger, the Exterra \\nDirectors considered a range of potential opportunities to assist with the funding of Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nSecond Fortune Gold Mine. The Exterra Directors considered that the potential benefits that \\ncould be realised through the Merger with Anova provided a superior and more certain \\noutcome for Exterra Shareholders than any of those other alternative opportunities. \\n\\nIt is important to note that shareholders in the Merged Group will still have an opportunity to \\nrealise a control premium in the event of any future change of control transaction for the \\nMerged Group. \\n\\nThere are risks in integrating the respective businesses of Exterra and Anova \\nThe long-term success of the Merged Group will depend, amongst other things, on the \\nsuccess of management in integrating the respective businesses and the strength of \\nmanagement of the Merged Group.  There is no guarantee that the businesses of the \\nMerged Group will be able to be integrated successfully within a reasonable period of time.  \\nThere are risks that any integration of the businesses of Exterra and Anova may take longer \\nthan expected and that anticipated efficiencies and benefits of that integration may be less \\nthan estimated.  These risks include possible differences in the management culture of the \\ntwo groups, inability to achieve synergy benefits and cost savings, and the potential loss of \\nkey personnel. \\n\\nThe exact value of the Scheme Consideration upon implementation of the \\nScheme is not certain  \\nThe exact value of this Scheme Consideration that would be realised by individual Exterra \\nShareholders upon implementation of the Scheme is not certain, as it will depend on the \\nprice at which the New Anova Shares trade on ASX. \\n\\nFollowing the implementation of the Merger, the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share price may rise or fall \\nbased on market conditions and the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial and operational performance.  \\nIf the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share price falls, the value of the Anova Shares received by Exterra \\nShareholders as Scheme Consideration will decline in value.  Accordingly, there is no \\nguarantee that the implied value of the Scheme Consideration to be received under the \\nMerger will be the same as the implied value of that consideration as at the date of \\nannouncement of the Merger. \\n\\nIn addition, the Sale Agent will be issued the Anova Shares that would otherwise be issued \\nto Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders, and will sell them on \\nmarket as soon as reasonably practicable after the Implementation Date (see Section 2.13).  \\nAlthough the quantum of these sales is expected to be limited, it is possible that such sales \\nmay exert downward pressure on the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share price during the applicable \\nperiod. \\n\\nOther relevant considerations \\n\\nImplications for Exterra if the Merger is not implemented \\nIf the Merger is not implemented, Exterra will continue to operate its current business on a \\nstand-alone basis.  Each Exterra Shareholder will retain their Exterra Shares and will not \\nreceive any New Anova Shares.   \\n\\nIn these circumstances, and in the absence of a Superior Proposal emerging, there would \\ncontinue to be uncertainty regarding Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to successfully fund the development of \\nthe Second Fortune Gold Mine on a stand-alone basis. Further, Exterra is likely to need to \\nraise additional working capital in the short term to fund its ongoing activities and will also \\nneed to repay any amounts drawn down under the Anova Loan Facility (if any) by their due \\ndate. \\n\\nAs a result, Exterra Shares may trade below their current market price (or the value \\nattributed by the Independent Expert) if the Merger is not implemented.   \\n\\npage 14 \\n\\n\\x0cThe Merger may be implemented even if you do not vote, or vote against the \\nScheme \\nYou should be aware that even if you do not vote, or you vote against the Scheme, the \\nScheme may still be implemented if it is approved by the requisite majority of Exterra \\nShareholders and by the Court. \\n\\nIf this occurs and you are an Exterra Shareholder, your Exterra Shares will be transferred to \\nAnova and you will receive Anova Shares (unless you are an Ineligible Foreign Shareholder \\nor an Electing Small Shareholder, in which case you should refer to Sections 2.11, 2.12 and \\n2.13) even though you did not vote on, or voted against, the Scheme. \\n\\nCosts of the Scheme \\nExterra has incurred significant costs in responding to the proposed Scheme and revisions of \\nthat proposal to the point that it is capable of being provided to Exterra Shareholders as a \\nscheme of arrangement for their consideration. These costs include negotiation with Anova, \\nretention of advisers, provision of information to Anova, facilitating Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s access to due \\ndiligence, conducting due diligence on Anova, engagement of the Independent Expert and \\nthe preparation of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nIf the Scheme is implemented, these costs will effectively be met by Anova as the ultimate \\ncontroller of Exterra following implementation of the Scheme. If the Scheme is not \\nimplemented and if no Superior Proposal emerges and is completed, Exterra will bear those \\ncosts. In certain circumstances, Exterra may have a right to claim a liquidated amount of \\n$250,000 from Anova (by way of the Break Fee) under the Merger Implementation \\nAgreement. There are also circumstances where Anova may be able to claim the same \\namount from Exterra by way of the Break Fee. Further details of such Break Fee \\narrangements are set out in Section 9.5 of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 15 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n2 \\n\\n2.1 \\n\\nSummary of the Scheme \\n\\nBackground \\nOn 8 June 2017, Exterra and Anova announced a proposal for the Merger of Exterra and \\nAnova by way of a scheme of arrangement between Exterra and its shareholders.  If the \\nScheme proceeds: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nall Exterra Shares will be transferred to Anova; \\n\\nall Exterra Shareholders as at the Record Date (whether or not they voted for or \\nagainst the Scheme), other than Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing \\nSmall Shareholders, will receive the Scheme Consideration, being shares in \\nAnova; and \\n\\nExterra will be de-listed from ASX and will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of \\nAnova. \\n\\nThis Scheme Booklet contains important information that the Exterra Board believes Exterra \\nShareholders should consider in deciding whether or not to vote in favour of the Scheme. \\n\\n2.2  What you will receive \\n\\nIf the Scheme is approved and implemented, eligible Exterra Shareholders will receive one \\nNew Anova Share for every two Exterra Shares they hold as at the Record Date. \\n\\nWritten confirmation of your holding of New Anova Shares is expected to be despatched to \\nyou within five Business Days after the Implementation Date. \\n\\nIneligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders should refer to Sections \\n2.11, 2.12 and 2.13 for further details about the consideration that they will receive and the \\ntiming of receipt of that consideration. \\n\\n2.3 \\n\\nRecommendation and voting intentions of Exterra Directors \\nFor the reasons set out in Section 1, the Exterra Directors unanimously recommend that \\nExterra Shareholders vote in favour of the Scheme at the Scheme Meeting, in the absence \\nof a Superior Proposal. \\n\\nThe interests of Exterra Directors are disclosed in Section 10.1 of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nIf a Superior Proposal emerges, this will be announced to the ASX and the Exterra Directors \\nwill carefully reconsider the Scheme and advise you of their recommendation. \\n\\nEach of your directors intends to vote all Exterra Shares held or controlled by them in favour \\nof the Scheme, in the absence of a Superior Proposal. \\n\\n2.4 \\n\\nIndependent Expert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conclusions \\nThe Exterra Directors commissioned the Independent Expert, BDO Corporate Finance (WA) \\nPty Ltd, to prepare a report on the Scheme on whether the transaction contemplated by the \\nScheme is in the best interests of Scheme Shareholders.  \\n\\nThe Independent Expert has concluded that in the absence of a Superior Proposal, the \\nScheme is fair and reasonable and therefore in the best interests of Exterra Shareholders.  \\n\\nFor further details, you should refer to Section 1.2(b) and the Independent Expert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Report \\nwhich is set out in full in Annexure A to this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 16 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n2.5 \\n\\nOther alternatives considered \\nPrior to entering into the Merger Implementation Agreement with Anova, Exterra investigated \\na range of potential alternatives to access funding to progress development of its Second \\nFortune Gold Mine (part of the Linden Gold Project). Following negotiations with Anova, the \\nExterra Board determined that the proposed Merger provided a superior outcome to Exterra \\nShareholders compared to the other alternatives available to Exterra. \\n\\nSince the Scheme was announced, no Alternative Proposal has emerged.   \\n\\n2.6 \\n\\nConditions of the Scheme \\nThe Scheme is subject to a number of Conditions Precedent in addition to the requisite \\nmajorities of shareholders approving the Scheme Resolution, including: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nthe Court approving the Scheme.   \\n\\nno temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order \\npreventing the Scheme being in effect at 8.00am on the Second Court Date. \\n\\nno Exterra Material Adverse Change or Anova Material Adverse Change occurring. \\n\\nno Exterra Prescribed Event or Anova Prescribed Event occurring. \\n\\nbefore 8.00am on the Second Court Date, binding agreements having been \\nentered into in relation to a sufficient number of Exterra Options to permit Anova to \\ncompulsorily acquire any remaining Exterra Options.  \\n\\nthe aggregate of Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cash assets and receivables, less any trade creditors, \\nbeing above $5,500,000 as at 8.00am on the Second Court Date. \\n\\nThe Scheme will not proceed unless all the Conditions Precedent are satisfied or waived in \\naccordance with the Merger Implementation Agreement.  Further information regarding \\nthese Conditions Precedent and other conditions to the Scheme are set out in Section 9.2. \\n\\nAs at the date of this Scheme Booklet, Exterra and Anova are not aware of any \\ncircumstances which would cause the Conditions Precedent to the Scheme referred to \\nabove and set out in more detail in Section 9.2 not to be satisfied. \\n\\n2.7 \\n\\nIf the Scheme does not proceed \\nIf the Scheme does not proceed, Exterra Shareholders will continue to hold Exterra Shares.   \\n\\nIn the absence of any Alternative Proposal to the Scheme, Exterra will continue as a stand-\\nalone entity.  Exterra Shareholders will be exposed to the risks relating to Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business \\nset out in Section 7.   \\n\\nExterra would also need to repay any amounts drawn down under the Anova Loan Facility (if \\nany) on the date that is 18 months after the first drawdown (or any earlier date on which the \\noutstanding moneys become due and payable). Further information regarding the Anova \\nLoan Facility is set out in Sections 4.4(d) and 10.6(a) of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nDepending on the reasons why the Scheme does not proceed, either Exterra or Anova may \\nbe liable to pay a break fee of $250,000 to the other party (Break Fee).  The Break Fee is \\nnot payable if the Scheme does not proceed merely because Exterra Shareholders do not \\nvote in favour of the Scheme in sufficient numbers to meet the legal tests.  Further \\ninformation in relation to the Break Fee is set out in Section 9.5.   \\n\\nExterra will also be liable to pay certain transaction costs in relation to the Scheme, \\nregardless of whether or not the Scheme is implemented (although if the Scheme proceeds, \\nthese costs will effectively be met by Anova as the ultimate controller of Exterra following \\nimplementation of the Scheme).  If the Scheme does proceed, additional costs will be \\nincurred. \\n\\n \\n\\npage 17 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n2.8 \\n\\n2.9 \\n\\nTax implications \\nThe transfer of your Exterra Shares pursuant to the Scheme may be a taxable transaction for \\nyou.  You should seek your own professional advice regarding the individual tax \\nconsequences applicable to you.  A summary of relevant taxation implications for Australian \\nresidents is contained in Section 8 of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nNo brokerage or stamp duty \\nNo brokerage or stamp duty will be payable by Scheme Shareholders on the transfer of their \\nScheme Shares to Anova under the Scheme or the issue by Anova to them of the New \\nAnova Shares as the Scheme Consideration. \\n\\nHowever, Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders should be aware \\nthat any brokerage fees paid by the Sale Agent (and other applicable costs, taxes and \\ncharges) will be deducted from the proceeds payable to them following the sale of the \\nrelevant New Anova Shares. See Section 2.13 below for further information. \\n\\n2.10  Warranties by Exterra Shareholders \\n\\n2.11 \\n\\nThe Scheme provides that each Scheme Shareholder is taken to have warranted to Exterra, \\nin its own right and for the benefit of Anova, that all their Exterra Shares which are \\ntransferred under the Scheme will, at the date of transfer, be fully paid and free from all \\nmortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, and that \\nthey have full power and capacity to sell and to transfer their Exterra Shares to Anova. \\n\\nIf you have any concerns about your ability to give this warranty, you should speak to your \\nprofessional adviser. \\n\\nForeign Shareholders \\nAn Exterra Shareholder whose address shown in the Exterra Register is a place outside \\nAustralia and its external territories, New Zealand or Hong Kong is an Ineligible Foreign \\nShareholder under the Scheme, unless Exterra and Anova are reasonably satisfied that the \\nissue of New Anova Shares to the foreign shareholder in that jurisdiction is neither prohibited \\nby law nor unduly onerous.  Anova is not obliged to issue New Anova Shares to an Ineligible \\nForeign Shareholder.  The New Anova Shares that would otherwise have been issued to an \\nIneligible Foreign Shareholder will be issued to the Sale Agent (and/or to a nominee of the \\nSale Agent) on the Implementation Date and dealt with in the manner described in Section \\n2.13.   \\n\\nThis Scheme Booklet does not constitute an offer of Anova Shares in any jurisdiction in \\nwhich it would be unlawful. In particular, this Scheme Booklet may not be distributed to any \\nperson, and the Anova Shares may not be offered or sold, in any country outside Australia \\nand its external territories, New Zealand and Hong Kong.  \\n\\nExterra Shareholders whose address shown on the Exterra Register is outside of the \\naforementioned jurisdictions should refer to the Important Notices section of this Scheme \\nBooklet. \\n\\n2.12  Small Shareholders \\n\\nA Scheme Shareholder who is entitled to receive 4,000 or less New Anova Shares under the \\nScheme may elect to have those New Anova Shares allotted to the Sale Agent and receive \\ncash proceeds instead.  \\n\\nSmall Shareholders that wish to make such an election must complete an Election Form. \\nElection Forms will accompany copies of this Scheme Booklet sent to those Exterra \\nShareholders who hold 8,000 Exterra Shares or less at the time for determining Exterra \\nShareholders entitled to be sent a copy of the Scheme Booklet. Small Shareholders may \\nalso obtain a copy from the Exterra Registry. An Election Form will only be valid if it is \\n\\n \\n\\npage 18 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\ncompleted in accordance with the instructions on the Election Form and is received by the \\nExterra Registry by 5.00pm on the Record Date. \\n\\nNew Anova Shares that would otherwise have been issued to Electing Small Shareholders \\nwill be issued to the Sale Agent (and/or to a nominee of the Sale Agent) on the \\nImplementation Date and dealt with in the manner described in Section 2.13. \\n\\n2.13  Sale of New Anova Shares by the Sale Agent \\n\\nAs indicated in Sections 2.11 and 2.12, Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small \\nShareholders will not receive New Anova Shares under the Scheme.  Instead, the New \\nAnova Shares that would otherwise have been issued to Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and \\nElecting Small Shareholders will be issued to the Sale Agent on the Implementation Date.  \\nAnova will:  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nprocure that the Sale Agent sells all the New Anova Shares issued to the Sale \\nAgent not more than fifteen Business Days after the Implementation Date on such \\nterms as the Sale Agent determines in good faith; and  \\n\\nremit to the Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders their \\nproportion of the net proceeds, in full satisfaction of the rights of each Ineligible \\nForeign Shareholder and each Electing Small Shareholder to the Scheme \\nConsideration. \\n\\nFor each New Anova Share to which an Ineligible Foreign Shareholder or Electing Small \\nShareholder is entitled, the Ineligible Foreign Shareholder or Electing Small Shareholder will, \\npromptly after the last sale of New Anova Shares by the Sale Agent, be paid an amount \\nequal to the number of New Anova Shares which would have been issued to that \\nshareholder divided by the total number of New Anova Shares issued to the Sale Agent.  \\n\\nAny brokerage fees paid by the Sale Agent in respect of the sale of the New Anova Shares \\nissued to the Sale Agent that would otherwise have been issued to Ineligible Foreign \\nShareholders and Electing Small Shareholders will be deducted from the sale proceeds \\npayable to Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders.  Other selling \\ncosts, taxes and charges will also be deducted from the proceeds payable to Ineligible \\nForeign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders. \\n\\nExterra, Anova and the Sale Agent give no assurance as to the price that will be achieved for \\nthe sale of New Anova Shares described above.  The proceeds that Ineligible Foreign \\nShareholders and Electing Small Shareholders will be paid may be more or less than the \\ncurrent market value of Anova Shares. \\n\\nThe sale of the New Anova Shares by the Sale Agent may result in a number of New Anova \\nShares being offered for sale at the same time.  Although the number of New Anova Shares \\nto be sold is not expected to be material, this may have the effect of depressing the sale \\nprice of Anova Shares. \\n\\nThe proceeds of the sale of the New Anova Shares will be paid to each relevant Ineligible \\nForeign Shareholder and Electing Shareholder either by sending a cheque by prepaid post \\nto that shareholder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s registered address as at the Record Date or by making a deposit into \\nan account with an Australian bank nominated by that shareholder to Exterra or the Exterra \\nRegistry at the Record Date. \\n\\nUnder the Scheme, Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders appoint \\nExterra as their agent to receive on their behalf any financial services guide or other notice \\ngiven by the Sale Agent. Copies of any documents received by Exterra from the Sale Agent \\nas agent for the Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders will be \\nmade available on request to Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s company secretary.  \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 19 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n2.14 \\n\\nTreatment of Exterra Options \\nUnder the Merger Implementation Agreement, Exterra and Anova agreed to use their \\nreasonable endeavours to procure that each Exterra Optionholder enter into an agreement \\nfor the cancellation of their Exterra Options in exchange for the grant of Anova Options at a \\nratio of one Anova Option for every two Exterra Options held.  \\n\\nThe cancellation of Exterra Options and issue of Anova Options is subject to the Scheme \\nbecoming Effective and is to take effect on the Implementation Date. Further details of the \\ncancellation of the Exterra Options, and Anova Options to be issued to Exterra \\nOptionholders, are set out in Section 10.7. \\n\\nExterra has obtained a waiver from ASX to permit the Exterra Options to be cancelled for \\nconsideration without requiring separate Exterra Shareholder approval. \\n\\n \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 20 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n3 \\nQuestion \\n\\nFrequently asked questions \\n\\nAnswer \\n\\nFurther information \\n\\nGeneral questions \\n\\nWhat are \\nExterra \\nShareholders \\nbeing asked to \\nconsider? \\n\\nOn 8 June 2017, Exterra and Anova announced a proposal to \\nmerge.

The Second Fortune Gold Mine is part of the Linden Gold Project and was \\noriginally mined from 1941 to 1988.  \\n\\nExterra acquired the Linden Gold Project from Haoma Mining NL in 2009 and the project \\nformed part of Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s primary undertaking at the time that the company listed on ASX in \\n2011. \\n\\nUnder Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ownership, the Linden Gold Project is well advanced and the Second \\nFortune Gold Mine has received all material regulatory approvals required to enable mine \\ndevelopment to commence. Subject to completion of key development milestones \\nsummarised below, first gold production is targeted for the first quarter of 2018 from the \\nSecond Fortune Gold Mine.  \\n\\nFeasibility Study and development status \\nThe results of the Feasibility Study on the Linden Gold Project were announced on 25 May \\n2017.  \\n\\nThe Feasibility Study concluded that the Second Fortune Gold Mine is financially and \\ntechnically viable based on developing a mine below the existing open pit and generating a \\nsorted concentrate for toll treating. The Feasibility Study proposes the ore would be trucked \\nto the Lakewood Plant located approximately five kilometres south-east of Kalgoorlie.  \\n\\nThe Linden Gold Project scope includes the development of a high-grade underground mine \\nand processing infrastructure to produce sorted ore concentrates.  A new portal and decline \\nwill provide access to the proposed mine. The development strategy includes the use of ore \\nsorting technology to pre-concentrate ore in a process where dilution and low-grade material \\nare rejected post mining and before haulage and processing in a conventional carbon in \\nleach toll treatment facility. Surface infrastructure includes mining workshops, a power plant, \\nmine camp, and evaporation ponds.  \\n\\nThe development phase and sorting proof of concept, including installation and operation of \\nsurface sorting plant, evaporation ponds and camp refurbishment plant was completed in \\nMay 2017.  \\n\\nAccordingly, the key outstanding phases required to bring the Second Fortune Gold Mine \\nthrough to production comprise:   \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nConstruction phase including completion of mining surface infrastructure \\n(workshop, power, changehouses) and camp expansion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 planned to commence in \\nSeptember 2017.  \\n\\nMining phase including portal and decline development, production \\ncommencement, ramp-up and steady stage operations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 planned to commence in \\nthe last quarter of 2017.  \\n\\nThe Feasibility Study assumes that the Second Fortune Gold Mine has a life of mine \\nproduction target of 392kt grading 5.8g/t Au for approximately 73koz of gold, resulting in \\n67,351 oz of gold recovered.   \\n\\npage 28 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Feasibility Study estimated that $9.4 million ($7.2 million capital costs and $2.2 million \\nworking capital) in funding is required to develop the Second Fortune Gold Mine, with an \\nadditional $3 million working capital contingency to be provisioned to mitigate operational \\nrisk.  \\n\\nThe 2-year life of mine is based upon Probable Ore Reserves (which comprises of that \\nportion of the Indicated Mineral Resources that is able to be converted into an Ore Reserve) \\n(88.7%) and Inferred Mineral Resources (11.3%). Exploration programmes at the Linden \\nGold Project area are continuing, which are aimed at expanding the current 131koz Mineral \\nResource. These are further detailed below.  \\n\\nFurther details regarding the Second Fortune Gold Mine are set out in the Independent \\nExpert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Report contained in Annexure A to this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nOre Reserves and Mineral Resource \\nBased on reverse circulation and diamond drilling by Exterra and previous operators, Exterra \\nhas outlined a Second Fortune Ore Reserve (Probable, Main Lode only) of 64,941 ounces of \\ngold at an average grade of 6.0 g/t Au and a Mineral Resource (Indicated and Inferred, all \\nlodes) of 130,600 ounces of gold at an average grade of 8.3 g/t Au.  \\nSecond Fortune Main Lode Ore Reserve  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nGrade \\n\\n \\n\\nProved Ore Reserve \\nAu g/t \\n\\nTonnes (t) \\n\\n- \\n\\nAu (oz) \\n\\n- \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nMetal \\n \\nNotes: Refer to Feasibility Study, ASX announcement dated 25 May 2017.   \\nSecond Fortune Mineral Resource  \\n\\n- \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nAu (oz) \\n64,941 \\n\\nProbable Ore Reserve \\nAu g/t \\n5.96 \\n\\nTonnes (t) \\n338,999 \\n\\nTotal Proved + Probable \\n\\nOre Reserve \\n\\nTonnes (t) \\n338,999 \\n\\nAu g/t \\n5.56 \\n\\nAu (oz) \\n64,941 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nLode \\n\\n \\n\\nMain \\nLode \\nHanging\\n\\nwall \\n\\nFootwall \\nWest  \\nTotal \\n\\nTonnes \\n\\n211,800 \\n\\n- \\n\\n18,500 \\n4,200 \\n234,500 \\n\\nIndicated \\n\\nGrade \\ng/t Au \\n\\nOunces \\n\\nInferred \\nTonnes  Grade \\ng/t Au \\n\\nTotal \\nOunces  Tonnes  Grade \\ng/tAu \\n\\n9.8 \\n\\n- \\n\\n8.9 \\n4.2 \\n9.6 \\n\\n66,700 \\n\\n35,400 \\n\\n- \\n\\n5,400 \\n600 \\n\\n72,700 \\n\\n58,200 \\n\\n52,900 \\n107,200 \\n253,700 \\n\\n8.0 \\n\\n8.2 \\n\\n7.4 \\n6.1 \\n7.1 \\n\\n9,100 \\n\\n247,200 \\n\\n15,300 \\n\\n58,200 \\n\\n12,500 \\n21,000 \\n57,900 \\n\\n71,400 \\n111,400 \\n488,200 \\n\\n9.6 \\n\\n8.2 \\n\\n7.8 \\n6.0 \\n8.3 \\n\\nOunce\\n\\ns \\n\\n75,800 \\n\\n15,300 \\n\\n17,900 \\n21,600 \\n130,600 \\n\\nNotes: \\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nIn respect of Second Fortune Main Lode Mineral Resource refer to Exterra ASX announcements dated 25 May \\n2017.  \\nIn respect of Second Fortune Minor Lodes Mineral Resource (which includes, Hangingwall, Footwall and West) \\nrefer to Exterra ASX announcement dated 6 August 2012.  \\nThe Second Fortune Minor Lode Mineral Resources information (which includes, Hangingwall, Footwall and \\nWest) was prepared under the JORC Code 2004 and reported by Exterra.

Under the terms of the farm-in \\narrangements, Exterra can earn a 75% interest in the project by producing 5,000 ounces of \\ngold from the project.  During the farm-in period, Exterra is entitled to receive 25% of the net \\nprofits from mining on the project. On the commencement of the joint venture, Exterra and \\nBar Twenty Pty Ltd must contribute to all ongoing expenditure on a 75/25 pro rata basis \\n(subject to Bar Twenty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to elect to a limited carry arrangement or convert its joint \\nventure interest into a right to receive a 2.5% net smelter return royalty in relation to gold \\nproduced from the project).  \\n\\nUnder the Bar Twenty joint venture agreement, Exterra has a right of first refusal to enter into \\nan agreement with Bar Twenty Pty Ltd over a further 7 gold prospects consisting of 8 \\nprospecting licences and 3 exploration licences, all located within 30km of the Second \\nFortune Gold Mine. \\n\\nThe Bar Twenty project development is expected to be run in parallel with the development \\nof the Second Fortune Gold Mine, and has the potential to generate a secondary source of \\nore to add to the planned production from the Second Fortune Gold Mine.  \\n\\nReverse circulation drilling is planned to commence early in July 2017, the results of which, \\nwill be combined with the current data available, will be used to generate a Mineral Resource \\nestimate which will form the basis of economic studies to determine the potential for mine \\ndevelopment. Ongoing project development work will focus on a potential mining operation \\npermitted under the existing approval of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMining Proposal for a Small Operation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\n\\npage 31 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nZelica1, 2 \\n \\nMalcolm 1, 3 \\n \\n\\nOther Project Mineral Resources \\n  Project \\n \\n\\nIndicated \\nTonnes  Grade \\ng/t Au \\n\\nInferred \\nOunces  Tonnes  Grade \\ng/t Au \\n\\n358,200 \\n\\n1.7 \\n\\n19,000 \\n\\n212,600 \\n\\n1.6 \\n\\nTotal \\nOunces  Tonnes  Grade \\ng/tAu \\n1.6 \\n\\n570,800 \\n\\n11,000 \\n\\nOunces \\n\\n30,000 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n142,200 \\n\\n8.3 \\n\\n37,900 \\n\\n142,200 \\n\\n8.3 \\n\\n37,900 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nNotes: \\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\nThe  information  in  this  table  was  prepared  and  first  disclosed  under  JORC  Code  2004  and  has  not  been \\nupdated to comply with JORC Code 2012 on the basis that the information has not materially changed since it \\nwas last reported. \\nRefer to Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ASX Announcement titled \\xe2\\x80\\x98Quarterly Activities and Cashflow Report\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dated 30 July 2012 for \\nfurther information in relation to the Zelica Mineral Resource estimate.

The financial information also complies with the recognition and \\nmeasurement requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and \\ninterpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. \\n\\nThe full financial accounts for FY15 and FY16 were audited by Rothsay Chartered Accounts. \\nRothsay Chartered Accounts issued unqualified audit reports for FY15 and FY16. However, \\nfor FY15, Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s auditor issued an emphasis of matter paragraph in the relevant audit \\nreport outlining the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt \\nabout Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to continue as a going concern. The FY16 audit report did not contain \\nany similar statement regarding Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to continue as a going concern. As outlined \\nin Section 1, one of the key reasons why Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Directors are supportive of the Scheme is \\nthat it will create a Merged Group with a strong balance sheet. \\n\\nThe financial information presented in the tables below does not represent complete financial \\nstatements and should therefore be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the \\nrespective periods, including the description of accounting policies contained in those \\nfinancial statements and the notes to those financial statements.

If the Merger proceeds, eligible Exterra Shareholders will receive \\none Anova Share for every two Exterra Shares held.  \\n\\nThe Merger will create a company that has an outstanding portfolio of gold production, development \\nand exploration projects under the guidance of an experienced and proven Board and management \\nteam. The Exterra Board believes that the combination of Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Big Springs Project in Nevada, USA \\nand strong balance sheet with Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s near term production Second Fortune Gold Mine in Western \\nAustralia (part of the Linden Gold Project) and surrounding exploration projects, is compelling for \\nshareholders of both companies. \\n\\nYour Directors consider the Merger to be in the best interests of Exterra Shareholders and have \\nunanimously recommended that Exterra Shareholders vote in favour of the Merger, in the absence of \\na Superior Proposal. \\n\\nIn forming their unanimous recommendation, your Directors have concluded that the Merger will \\nprovide a number of significant benefits to Exterra Shareholders, including the following: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nthe Merged Group will have a strong balance sheet with which to fast track production at \\nExterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Second Fortune Gold Mine; \\n\\nthe Merged Group will be larger and more diversified than Exterra, with two near term gold \\nproducing projects and a portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, located in \\nWestern Australia and Nevada, USA; \\n\\nthe Scheme Consideration represents a significant premium to historical trading prices of \\nExterra Shares; \\n\\nthe Merged Group is expected to have an enhanced market presence and greater liquidity \\nthan that currently enjoyed by Exterra Shareholders; \\n\\nthe combined Board and management team of the Merged Group will have the skills and \\ncapacity to advance the production and development projects in parallel with exploration and \\nconsolidation activities; and \\n\\nthe Merged Group will be better placed to pursue further consolidation opportunities, with \\nimproved chances of success.  \\n\\nThis Scheme Booklet sets out your Directors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 views on the key advantages and disadvantages of the \\nproposed Merger, and addresses a range of other considerations and questions you may have as an \\nExterra Shareholder.  \\n\\nIn considering the Merger, you should be aware that the Independent Expert, BDO Corporate Finance \\n(WA) Pty Ltd, has formed the opinion that in the absence of a superior proposal, the Merger is fair and \\nreasonable and therefore in the best interests of Exterra Shareholders. The full report of the \\nIndependent Expert is set out in Annexure A.  \\n\\nI encourage you to read this Scheme Booklet (including the report of the Independent Expert) carefully \\nin full, and if required, to seek your own legal, financial or other professional advice.  \\n\\n \\n\\npage 3 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\nYour vote is important regardless of how many Exterra Shares you own.

The Merged Group is expected to benefit from the application of Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knowledge of ore \\nsorting technology to the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s projects as well as the consolidation of corporate overheads \\nand exploration activities. The Merged Group should also be well positioned to achieve further growth \\nby participating in logical future industry consolidation and rationalisation.  \\n\\nAs an Exterra Shareholder, your vote is important in order to ensure that the Merger is implemented \\nso that the benefits flowing from the Merger can be delivered to both sets of shareholders.  \\n\\nI am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for the Merged Group and believe that the Merger \\nwill unlock significant long-term value for shareholders of both companies.  \\n\\nOn behalf of the Anova Board, I encourage you to vote in favour of the Scheme and look forward to \\nwelcoming you as a shareholder of Anova following the successful implementation of the Merger. \\n\\nYours sincerely, \\n\\n \\nMalcolm James \\n \\n\\nNon-Executive Chairman \\nAnova Metals Limited \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 5 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nAction required by Exterra Shareholders \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\n4 \\n\\n \\n\\nYour vote is important \\nEvery Exterra Shareholder is urged to vote, regardless of the size of your \\nshareholding. \\nFor the Scheme to proceed, it is necessary that sufficient Exterra Shareholders vote in \\nfavour of the Scheme.

As Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market \\ncapitalisation was only approximately $13 million immediately prior to the announcement of \\nthe Scheme1, the funding requirements and risks associated with the development of the \\nSecond Fortune Gold Mine are considered to be significant were Exterra to proceed with the \\ndevelopment of that mine on a stand-alone basis.  \\n\\nAs at 31 May 2017, Anova had approximately $7.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and \\nno debt. Further, Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market capitalisation was approximately $56.7 million immediately \\nprior to the announcement of the Scheme.2  \\n\\nThe combination of Exterra with Anova will create a Merged Group that has a strong balance \\nsheet with pro forma cash as at 31 May 2017 of approximately $9.7 million and no debt. \\nTogether with the greater scale and diversity of the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operations, this is \\nexpected to result in: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nan increased ability to fast track production at the Second Fortune Gold Mine as \\nwell as pursue the growth of the balance of the asset portfolio; and \\n\\nan enhanced ability to source equity and debt funding on more favourable terms \\nthan would currently be available to Exterra. \\n\\n                                                      \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n1   Based on the closing price of Exterra Shares and Anova Shares on 5 June 2016 (being the last trading day prior to the \\n\\nannouncement of the Scheme. \\n\\n2   See note 1 above. \\n\\n \\n\\npage 9 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\nIn connection with the Scheme, Anova has made available to Exterra a $2 million loan facility \\nso as to provide Exterra with access to necessary funding to continue to progress the \\ndevelopment of the Second Fortune Gold Mine whilst the Scheme is being implemented. \\nFurther information on the loan provided to Exterra by Anova is set out in Sections 4.4(d) \\nand 10.6(a) of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nThe Independent Expert has concluded that in the absence of a superior \\nproposal, the Scheme is fair and reasonable and therefore is in the best \\ninterests of Exterra Shareholders \\nThe Independent Expert, BDO Corporate Finance (WA) Pty Ltd, has concluded that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe \\nScheme is fair and reasonable and therefore is in the best interests of Exterra Shareholders, \\nin the absence of a Superior Proposal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.   \\n\\nThe Independent Expert has assessed the value of two Exterra Shares, inclusive of the \\npremium for control, as being between $0.078 and $0.142, which compares with the \\nIndependent Expert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assessment of the value of the Scheme Consideration of between \\n$0.089 and $0.152 per Exterra Share (based on the sum-of-parts method, as the primary \\nvaluation method, and quoted market price basis as the secondary method). \\n\\nThe Independent Expert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Report is contained in Annexure A to this Scheme Booklet, and \\nExterra Shareholders are encouraged to read the report in full. \\n\\nThe Merged Group will be larger and more diversified than Exterra, with two \\nnear term gold producing projects and a portfolio of exploration and \\ndevelopment opportunities in Western Australia and Nevada, USA  \\nThe Merger of Anova and Exterra will create a larger growth focussed ASX-listed gold \\ncompany, with a pipeline of gold projects at various stages of development in Western \\nAustralia and the United States of America. \\n\\nThe Merged Group will have two near-term production projects in two different jurisdictions, \\nbeing:    \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nExterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Second Fortune Gold Mine (part of the Linden Gold Project) located in \\nLinden, Western Australia, which is expected to move into production in the first \\nquarter of 2018; and \\n\\nAnova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Big Springs Project located in Nevada, USA, which has received all \\npermits necessary to commence production on the 601 and 701 ore bodies, \\nfollowing lodgement of a reclamation bond. \\n\\nIn particular, the Merger will result in Exterra Shareholders obtaining an interest in the \\ndiversity of opportunities associated with the development of Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Big Springs Project in \\nNevada, USA, with near term production expected from an open pit mine with the potential \\nfor a staged progression into underground mining operations. \\n\\nThe Merged Group will also have a portfolio of exploration assets, including Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Zelica \\nGold Project and Malcolm Gold Project (both with existing Mineral Resources) as well as \\nexploration prospects in the Linden Gold Project (surrounding the Second Fortune Gold \\nMine) and Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s North Sammy, South Sammy and Beadles Creek prospects. The Merged \\nGroup\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portfolio will cover a broad range of prospects, from extension of existing Mineral \\nResources to regional exploration work, which is expected to provide the Merged Group with \\nstrong growth potential. \\n\\nThe Exterra Directors believe that the Merged Group will benefit from an improved risk \\nprofile resulting from the increased breadth of the asset portfolio with greater operational and \\n\\n \\n\\npage 10 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n(d) \\n\\n(e) \\n\\ngeographic diversification. Exterra Shareholders will collectively hold approximately 27.6% of \\nthe Merged Group immediately following the successful implementation of the Scheme. 3 \\n\\nThe Scheme Consideration represents a significant premium to historical \\ntrading prices of Exterra Shares \\nIf the Scheme is implemented, eligible Exterra Shareholders will receive one Anova Share \\nfor every two Exterra Shares that they hold.4 \\n\\nThe Scheme Consideration to be issued to Exterra Shareholders if the Scheme becomes \\nEffective represents a substantial premium of approximately: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n64% to the closing price of Exterra Shares of $0.038 on ASX on the Pre-\\nAnnouncement Date;5 \\n\\n61% to the VWAP of Exterra Shares over the 5 trading days up to and including \\nthe Pre-Announcement Date, compared to the VWAP of Anova Shares over the \\nsame period; and \\n\\n52% to the VWAP of Exterra Shares over the 30 days up to and including the Pre-\\nAnnouncement Date, compared to the VWAP of Anova Shares over the same \\nperiod. \\n\\nAs at the Last Practicable Date, the last closing price of Exterra Shares on ASX was $0.040 \\nand the closing price of Anova Shares on ASX was $0.078, such that the Scheme \\nConsideration represents a discount of 2.5% to the closing price of Exterra Shares at that \\ntime. The implied price of the Scheme Consideration will continue to fluctuate depending \\nupon the price at which Anova Shares trade on ASX. \\n\\nThe Merged Group is expected to have an enhanced market presence and \\ngreater liquidity than that currently enjoyed by Exterra Shareholders  \\nIf the Merger proceeds, you will benefit by receiving shares in the Merged Group that are \\nexpected to be substantially more liquid than Exterra Shares on a stand-alone basis. In the \\n12 month period up until the Pre Announcement Date, the daily average value of Anova \\nShares traded on ASX was approximately 2.5 times greater than the daily average value of \\nExterra Shares traded over that period.  \\n\\nFurther, the Merged Group will have a pro forma market capitalisation of approximately $78 \\nmillion. 6 The Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strengthened balance sheet, increased asset suite, larger \\nresource base and increased market capitalisation is expected to raise the profile of the \\nMerged Group in capital markets and widen the range of potential investors for the Merged \\nGroup. This in turn is expected to result in increased coverage of the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\noperations by analysts and enhance the liquidity of shares in the Merged Group, and may be \\nexpected to assist in a positive re-rating of the Merged Group. \\n\\nExterra Shareholders may also benefit from the potential re-rating of Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets in the \\nMerged Group, as the funding risks associated with the development of the Second Fortune \\nGold Mine are likely to be reduced for the Merged Group as opposed to if Exterra sought to \\nprogress the development of that project on a stand-alone basis.  \\n\\nExterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share price has strengthened since the announcement of the Merger. The last \\nclosing price of Exterra Shares on the Last Practicable Date was $0.040, representing an \\nincrease of approximately 5.26% to the last closing price of Exterra Shares on the Pre-\\n\\n                                                      \\n\\n3   Assuming that there are no Ineligible Shareholders and that Anova does not acquire any additional Exterra Shares outside \\n\\nof the Scheme. \\n\\n4   Foreign Exterra Shareholders should refer to the Important Notices and Section 2.11 of the Scheme Booklet to determine \\n\\nwhether they are eligible to receive Anova Shares pursuant to the Scheme. \\n\\n5   Based on the closing price of Anova Shares of $0.125 on ASX on the Pre-Announcement Date. \\n6   Refer to section 6.1 of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 11 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n(f) \\n\\n(g) \\n\\nAnnouncement Date of $0.038. The Exterra Board considers that the improved share price \\npost-announcement of the Merger is in part due to the improved confidence in Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nassets as part of the Merged Group. \\n\\nThe combined Board and management team of the Merged Group will have \\nthe skills and capacity to advance the production and development projects in \\nparallel with exploration and consolidation activities \\nThe Merger will capitalise on the combined talents of the boards and management teams of \\nboth Exterra and Anova.  \\n\\nThe Merged Group Board will be led by Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existing Chair, Mr Malcolm James, but will \\nbe strengthened by the addition of existing Exterra Board members in Mr Geoff Laing and Mr \\nJohn Davis. The Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management team will also be strengthened by the \\nappointment of Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existing Executive Director Mr Laing to the role of Technical \\nDirector as a key member of Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s executive management team. Further information \\nregarding the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Board and management team is set out in Sections 6.4 and \\n6.5 of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nThe integration of the boards and management teams of Exterra and Anova is expected to \\nallow for a more effective allocation of resources to the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s portfolio of \\nproduction, development and exploration assets, as well as the ability to apply Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nknowledge of ore sorting technology to the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s projects. It is also expected to \\nresult in the Merged Group having the capacity to develop production and development \\nassets at the same time as undertaking exploration and consolidation activities. In addition, \\nefficiencies should be realised as a result of consolidating the corporate and administrative \\noverheads of both companies. \\n\\nThe Merged Group will be better placed to pursue further consolidation \\nopportunities, with improved chances of success \\nThe Merged Group will have project portfolios in two gold mining jurisdictions, which can be \\nleveraged off to pursue a greater range of consolidation opportunities to further grow the \\nbusiness.  Importantly, the depth of the Board and management team of the Merged Group \\nprovides the capacity to investigate and execute potential consolidation opportunities in \\nparallel to the ongoing development of the existing asset portfolio.   \\n\\nThe increased scale and financial strength of the Merged Group is likely to improve its \\nchanges of successfully completing any such consolidation opportunities (should they arise) \\nthan Exterra would have if it was pursuing such opportunities on a stand-alone basis.  \\n\\n1.3 \\n\\nPotential disadvantages or risks associated with the Scheme \\nThe Scheme has a number of potential disadvantages and risks that Exterra Shareholders \\nshould consider in deciding whether or not to vote in favour of the Scheme. \\n\\nWhile the Exterra Board is of the opinion that these disadvantages and risks are outweighed \\nby the Scheme\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advantages, and that the Scheme is in the best interests of Exterra \\nShareholders in the absence of a Superior Proposal, Exterra Shareholders should consider \\ntheir individual circumstances in determining how to vote in relation to the Scheme. \\n\\nYou may disagree with the recommendations by the Independent Expert and \\nthe Exterra Directors \\nNotwithstanding the unanimous recommendation by the Exterra Directors, and the \\nconclusion reached by the Independent Expert that in the absence of a superior proposal, \\nthe Scheme is fair and reasonable to Exterra Shareholders and therefore in the best \\ninterests of Exterra Shareholders, you may believe that the Scheme is not in your best \\ninterests and believe that the Scheme Consideration is inadequate.  \\n\\npage 12 \\n\\n(a) \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\nYour percentage interest in the Merged Group will be reduced relative to your \\ncurrent interest in Exterra \\nIf the Merger is implemented, Exterra Shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 combined equity interest in the assets of \\nExterra will reduce from 100% to approximately 27.6%. However, it is important that Exterra \\nShareholders appreciate that in the absence of the Merger:  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nthere is likely to be continued uncertainty regarding the funding of the development \\nof Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Second Fortune Gold Mine, with alternative potential financing options \\npresenting other challenges and risks for Exterra Shareholders;  \\n\\nthere may be delays in the planned schedule to produce gold from Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nSecond Fortune Gold Mine whilst the required funding is secured; and \\n\\nExterra Shareholders will not acquire a 27.6% equity interest in the assets of \\nAnova, which includes Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Big Springs Gold Project, in Nevada, USA, and so \\nwill not diversify their risk profile away from Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s existing Western Australian \\nasset base. \\n\\nIf the Merger does not proceed, Exterra will also need to repay amounts drawn down under \\nthe loan facility provided by Anova, or otherwise seek to have those amounts converted into \\nExterra Shares. However, under the terms of the loan facility negotiated with Anova, the \\nobligation to repay amounts drawn down under that facility is not accelerated as a result of \\nthe failure of the proposed Merger, such that Exterra Directors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 believe that there should be \\nsufficient time in which to seek to refinance any such amounts.  \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nThe investment profile for Exterra Shareholders will change and you may \\nconsider the investment profile of the Merged Group to be inferior to that of \\nExterra as a stand-alone entity \\nThe operational and geographical profile, capital structure and size of the Merged Group will \\nbe different to that of Exterra on a stand-alone basis.   \\n\\nIt is possible that certain Exterra Shareholders may wish to maintain an interest in Exterra as \\na stand-alone entity because they are seeking an investment in a publicly listed company \\nwith the specific characteristics of Exterra.  The change in investment profile resulting from \\nthe Merger may be considered to be a disadvantage to such shareholders. \\n\\nIn addition, if the Scheme is implemented, there will be a change in the risk profile to which \\nExterra Shareholders are exposed. Exterra will merge its business with that of Anova and \\nExterra Shareholders will receive New Anova Shares.  As a consequence, Exterra \\nShareholders will be exposed to risk factors relating to Anova, and to certain additional risks \\nrelating to the Merged Group and the integration of the two companies.  These include risks \\nrelating to the operation of a broader suite of assets than Exterra currently holds.  In a \\nnumber of cases, those risks are different from or additional to those currently faced by \\nExterra Shareholders.  The change in risk profile may be seen to be a disadvantage by some \\nExterra Shareholders. \\n\\nSection 7 discusses the risk factors relating to Exterra, Anova and the Merged Group.  \\nExterra Shareholders are encouraged to read that section in its entirety.  It is also important \\nto note that certain risks will apply if the Scheme does not proceed.  These are also \\ndiscussed in Section 7. \\n\\nYou may consider that there is the potential for a Superior Proposal to be \\nmade to Exterra in the foreseeable future  \\nIt is possible that a Superior Proposal for Exterra may materialise in the future which is more \\nattractive for Exterra Shareholders than the Merger.  The implementation of the Merger \\nwould mean that Exterra Shareholders would not be able to obtain the benefit of any such \\nproposal. \\n\\nThe Exterra Board is not currently aware of any such proposal, nor are they aware of any \\nparty with an intention to make such a proposal. \\n\\npage 13 \\n\\n(d) \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n(e) \\n\\n(f) \\n\\n1.4 \\n\\n(a) \\n\\n \\n\\nExterra Shareholders should be aware that before proceeding with the Merger, the Exterra \\nDirectors considered a range of potential opportunities to assist with the funding of Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\nSecond Fortune Gold Mine. The Exterra Directors considered that the potential benefits that \\ncould be realised through the Merger with Anova provided a superior and more certain \\noutcome for Exterra Shareholders than any of those other alternative opportunities. \\n\\nIt is important to note that shareholders in the Merged Group will still have an opportunity to \\nrealise a control premium in the event of any future change of control transaction for the \\nMerged Group. \\n\\nThere are risks in integrating the respective businesses of Exterra and Anova \\nThe long-term success of the Merged Group will depend, amongst other things, on the \\nsuccess of management in integrating the respective businesses and the strength of \\nmanagement of the Merged Group.  There is no guarantee that the businesses of the \\nMerged Group will be able to be integrated successfully within a reasonable period of time.  \\nThere are risks that any integration of the businesses of Exterra and Anova may take longer \\nthan expected and that anticipated efficiencies and benefits of that integration may be less \\nthan estimated.  These risks include possible differences in the management culture of the \\ntwo groups, inability to achieve synergy benefits and cost savings, and the potential loss of \\nkey personnel. \\n\\nThe exact value of the Scheme Consideration upon implementation of the \\nScheme is not certain  \\nThe exact value of this Scheme Consideration that would be realised by individual Exterra \\nShareholders upon implementation of the Scheme is not certain, as it will depend on the \\nprice at which the New Anova Shares trade on ASX. \\n\\nFollowing the implementation of the Merger, the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share price may rise or fall \\nbased on market conditions and the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial and operational performance.  \\nIf the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share price falls, the value of the Anova Shares received by Exterra \\nShareholders as Scheme Consideration will decline in value.  Accordingly, there is no \\nguarantee that the implied value of the Scheme Consideration to be received under the \\nMerger will be the same as the implied value of that consideration as at the date of \\nannouncement of the Merger. \\n\\nIn addition, the Sale Agent will be issued the Anova Shares that would otherwise be issued \\nto Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders, and will sell them on \\nmarket as soon as reasonably practicable after the Implementation Date (see Section 2.13).  \\nAlthough the quantum of these sales is expected to be limited, it is possible that such sales \\nmay exert downward pressure on the Merged Group\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share price during the applicable \\nperiod. \\n\\nOther relevant considerations \\n\\nImplications for Exterra if the Merger is not implemented \\nIf the Merger is not implemented, Exterra will continue to operate its current business on a \\nstand-alone basis.  Each Exterra Shareholder will retain their Exterra Shares and will not \\nreceive any New Anova Shares.   \\n\\nIn these circumstances, and in the absence of a Superior Proposal emerging, there would \\ncontinue to be uncertainty regarding Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to successfully fund the development of \\nthe Second Fortune Gold Mine on a stand-alone basis. Further, Exterra is likely to need to \\nraise additional working capital in the short term to fund its ongoing activities and will also \\nneed to repay any amounts drawn down under the Anova Loan Facility (if any) by their due \\ndate. \\n\\nAs a result, Exterra Shares may trade below their current market price (or the value \\nattributed by the Independent Expert) if the Merger is not implemented.   \\n\\npage 14 \\n\\n\\x0cThe Merger may be implemented even if you do not vote, or vote against the \\nScheme \\nYou should be aware that even if you do not vote, or you vote against the Scheme, the \\nScheme may still be implemented if it is approved by the requisite majority of Exterra \\nShareholders and by the Court. \\n\\nIf this occurs and you are an Exterra Shareholder, your Exterra Shares will be transferred to \\nAnova and you will receive Anova Shares (unless you are an Ineligible Foreign Shareholder \\nor an Electing Small Shareholder, in which case you should refer to Sections 2.11, 2.12 and \\n2.13) even though you did not vote on, or voted against, the Scheme. \\n\\nCosts of the Scheme \\nExterra has incurred significant costs in responding to the proposed Scheme and revisions of \\nthat proposal to the point that it is capable of being provided to Exterra Shareholders as a \\nscheme of arrangement for their consideration. These costs include negotiation with Anova, \\nretention of advisers, provision of information to Anova, facilitating Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s access to due \\ndiligence, conducting due diligence on Anova, engagement of the Independent Expert and \\nthe preparation of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nIf the Scheme is implemented, these costs will effectively be met by Anova as the ultimate \\ncontroller of Exterra following implementation of the Scheme. If the Scheme is not \\nimplemented and if no Superior Proposal emerges and is completed, Exterra will bear those \\ncosts. In certain circumstances, Exterra may have a right to claim a liquidated amount of \\n$250,000 from Anova (by way of the Break Fee) under the Merger Implementation \\nAgreement. There are also circumstances where Anova may be able to claim the same \\namount from Exterra by way of the Break Fee. Further details of such Break Fee \\narrangements are set out in Section 9.5 of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n(b) \\n\\n(c) \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 15 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n2 \\n\\n2.1 \\n\\nSummary of the Scheme \\n\\nBackground \\nOn 8 June 2017, Exterra and Anova announced a proposal for the Merger of Exterra and \\nAnova by way of a scheme of arrangement between Exterra and its shareholders.  If the \\nScheme proceeds: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nall Exterra Shares will be transferred to Anova; \\n\\nall Exterra Shareholders as at the Record Date (whether or not they voted for or \\nagainst the Scheme), other than Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing \\nSmall Shareholders, will receive the Scheme Consideration, being shares in \\nAnova; and \\n\\nExterra will be de-listed from ASX and will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of \\nAnova. \\n\\nThis Scheme Booklet contains important information that the Exterra Board believes Exterra \\nShareholders should consider in deciding whether or not to vote in favour of the Scheme. \\n\\n2.2  What you will receive \\n\\nIf the Scheme is approved and implemented, eligible Exterra Shareholders will receive one \\nNew Anova Share for every two Exterra Shares they hold as at the Record Date. \\n\\nWritten confirmation of your holding of New Anova Shares is expected to be despatched to \\nyou within five Business Days after the Implementation Date. \\n\\nIneligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders should refer to Sections \\n2.11, 2.12 and 2.13 for further details about the consideration that they will receive and the \\ntiming of receipt of that consideration. \\n\\n2.3 \\n\\nRecommendation and voting intentions of Exterra Directors \\nFor the reasons set out in Section 1, the Exterra Directors unanimously recommend that \\nExterra Shareholders vote in favour of the Scheme at the Scheme Meeting, in the absence \\nof a Superior Proposal. \\n\\nThe interests of Exterra Directors are disclosed in Section 10.1 of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nIf a Superior Proposal emerges, this will be announced to the ASX and the Exterra Directors \\nwill carefully reconsider the Scheme and advise you of their recommendation. \\n\\nEach of your directors intends to vote all Exterra Shares held or controlled by them in favour \\nof the Scheme, in the absence of a Superior Proposal. \\n\\n2.4 \\n\\nIndependent Expert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conclusions \\nThe Exterra Directors commissioned the Independent Expert, BDO Corporate Finance (WA) \\nPty Ltd, to prepare a report on the Scheme on whether the transaction contemplated by the \\nScheme is in the best interests of Scheme Shareholders.  \\n\\nThe Independent Expert has concluded that in the absence of a Superior Proposal, the \\nScheme is fair and reasonable and therefore in the best interests of Exterra Shareholders.  \\n\\nFor further details, you should refer to Section 1.2(b) and the Independent Expert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Report \\nwhich is set out in full in Annexure A to this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 16 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n2.5 \\n\\nOther alternatives considered \\nPrior to entering into the Merger Implementation Agreement with Anova, Exterra investigated \\na range of potential alternatives to access funding to progress development of its Second \\nFortune Gold Mine (part of the Linden Gold Project). Following negotiations with Anova, the \\nExterra Board determined that the proposed Merger provided a superior outcome to Exterra \\nShareholders compared to the other alternatives available to Exterra. \\n\\nSince the Scheme was announced, no Alternative Proposal has emerged.   \\n\\n2.6 \\n\\nConditions of the Scheme \\nThe Scheme is subject to a number of Conditions Precedent in addition to the requisite \\nmajorities of shareholders approving the Scheme Resolution, including: \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nthe Court approving the Scheme.   \\n\\nno temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order \\npreventing the Scheme being in effect at 8.00am on the Second Court Date. \\n\\nno Exterra Material Adverse Change or Anova Material Adverse Change occurring. \\n\\nno Exterra Prescribed Event or Anova Prescribed Event occurring. \\n\\nbefore 8.00am on the Second Court Date, binding agreements having been \\nentered into in relation to a sufficient number of Exterra Options to permit Anova to \\ncompulsorily acquire any remaining Exterra Options.  \\n\\nthe aggregate of Anova\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cash assets and receivables, less any trade creditors, \\nbeing above $5,500,000 as at 8.00am on the Second Court Date. \\n\\nThe Scheme will not proceed unless all the Conditions Precedent are satisfied or waived in \\naccordance with the Merger Implementation Agreement.  Further information regarding \\nthese Conditions Precedent and other conditions to the Scheme are set out in Section 9.2. \\n\\nAs at the date of this Scheme Booklet, Exterra and Anova are not aware of any \\ncircumstances which would cause the Conditions Precedent to the Scheme referred to \\nabove and set out in more detail in Section 9.2 not to be satisfied. \\n\\n2.7 \\n\\nIf the Scheme does not proceed \\nIf the Scheme does not proceed, Exterra Shareholders will continue to hold Exterra Shares.   \\n\\nIn the absence of any Alternative Proposal to the Scheme, Exterra will continue as a stand-\\nalone entity.  Exterra Shareholders will be exposed to the risks relating to Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business \\nset out in Section 7.   \\n\\nExterra would also need to repay any amounts drawn down under the Anova Loan Facility (if \\nany) on the date that is 18 months after the first drawdown (or any earlier date on which the \\noutstanding moneys become due and payable). Further information regarding the Anova \\nLoan Facility is set out in Sections 4.4(d) and 10.6(a) of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nDepending on the reasons why the Scheme does not proceed, either Exterra or Anova may \\nbe liable to pay a break fee of $250,000 to the other party (Break Fee).  The Break Fee is \\nnot payable if the Scheme does not proceed merely because Exterra Shareholders do not \\nvote in favour of the Scheme in sufficient numbers to meet the legal tests.  Further \\ninformation in relation to the Break Fee is set out in Section 9.5.   \\n\\nExterra will also be liable to pay certain transaction costs in relation to the Scheme, \\nregardless of whether or not the Scheme is implemented (although if the Scheme proceeds, \\nthese costs will effectively be met by Anova as the ultimate controller of Exterra following \\nimplementation of the Scheme).  If the Scheme does proceed, additional costs will be \\nincurred. \\n\\n \\n\\npage 17 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n2.8 \\n\\n2.9 \\n\\nTax implications \\nThe transfer of your Exterra Shares pursuant to the Scheme may be a taxable transaction for \\nyou.  You should seek your own professional advice regarding the individual tax \\nconsequences applicable to you.  A summary of relevant taxation implications for Australian \\nresidents is contained in Section 8 of this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nNo brokerage or stamp duty \\nNo brokerage or stamp duty will be payable by Scheme Shareholders on the transfer of their \\nScheme Shares to Anova under the Scheme or the issue by Anova to them of the New \\nAnova Shares as the Scheme Consideration. \\n\\nHowever, Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders should be aware \\nthat any brokerage fees paid by the Sale Agent (and other applicable costs, taxes and \\ncharges) will be deducted from the proceeds payable to them following the sale of the \\nrelevant New Anova Shares. See Section 2.13 below for further information. \\n\\n2.10  Warranties by Exterra Shareholders \\n\\n2.11 \\n\\nThe Scheme provides that each Scheme Shareholder is taken to have warranted to Exterra, \\nin its own right and for the benefit of Anova, that all their Exterra Shares which are \\ntransferred under the Scheme will, at the date of transfer, be fully paid and free from all \\nmortgages, charges, liens, encumbrances and interests of third parties of any kind, and that \\nthey have full power and capacity to sell and to transfer their Exterra Shares to Anova. \\n\\nIf you have any concerns about your ability to give this warranty, you should speak to your \\nprofessional adviser. \\n\\nForeign Shareholders \\nAn Exterra Shareholder whose address shown in the Exterra Register is a place outside \\nAustralia and its external territories, New Zealand or Hong Kong is an Ineligible Foreign \\nShareholder under the Scheme, unless Exterra and Anova are reasonably satisfied that the \\nissue of New Anova Shares to the foreign shareholder in that jurisdiction is neither prohibited \\nby law nor unduly onerous.  Anova is not obliged to issue New Anova Shares to an Ineligible \\nForeign Shareholder.  The New Anova Shares that would otherwise have been issued to an \\nIneligible Foreign Shareholder will be issued to the Sale Agent (and/or to a nominee of the \\nSale Agent) on the Implementation Date and dealt with in the manner described in Section \\n2.13.   \\n\\nThis Scheme Booklet does not constitute an offer of Anova Shares in any jurisdiction in \\nwhich it would be unlawful. In particular, this Scheme Booklet may not be distributed to any \\nperson, and the Anova Shares may not be offered or sold, in any country outside Australia \\nand its external territories, New Zealand and Hong Kong.  \\n\\nExterra Shareholders whose address shown on the Exterra Register is outside of the \\naforementioned jurisdictions should refer to the Important Notices section of this Scheme \\nBooklet. \\n\\n2.12  Small Shareholders \\n\\nA Scheme Shareholder who is entitled to receive 4,000 or less New Anova Shares under the \\nScheme may elect to have those New Anova Shares allotted to the Sale Agent and receive \\ncash proceeds instead.  \\n\\nSmall Shareholders that wish to make such an election must complete an Election Form. \\nElection Forms will accompany copies of this Scheme Booklet sent to those Exterra \\nShareholders who hold 8,000 Exterra Shares or less at the time for determining Exterra \\nShareholders entitled to be sent a copy of the Scheme Booklet. Small Shareholders may \\nalso obtain a copy from the Exterra Registry. An Election Form will only be valid if it is \\n\\n \\n\\npage 18 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\ncompleted in accordance with the instructions on the Election Form and is received by the \\nExterra Registry by 5.00pm on the Record Date. \\n\\nNew Anova Shares that would otherwise have been issued to Electing Small Shareholders \\nwill be issued to the Sale Agent (and/or to a nominee of the Sale Agent) on the \\nImplementation Date and dealt with in the manner described in Section 2.13. \\n\\n2.13  Sale of New Anova Shares by the Sale Agent \\n\\nAs indicated in Sections 2.11 and 2.12, Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small \\nShareholders will not receive New Anova Shares under the Scheme.  Instead, the New \\nAnova Shares that would otherwise have been issued to Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and \\nElecting Small Shareholders will be issued to the Sale Agent on the Implementation Date.  \\nAnova will:  \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nprocure that the Sale Agent sells all the New Anova Shares issued to the Sale \\nAgent not more than fifteen Business Days after the Implementation Date on such \\nterms as the Sale Agent determines in good faith; and  \\n\\nremit to the Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders their \\nproportion of the net proceeds, in full satisfaction of the rights of each Ineligible \\nForeign Shareholder and each Electing Small Shareholder to the Scheme \\nConsideration. \\n\\nFor each New Anova Share to which an Ineligible Foreign Shareholder or Electing Small \\nShareholder is entitled, the Ineligible Foreign Shareholder or Electing Small Shareholder will, \\npromptly after the last sale of New Anova Shares by the Sale Agent, be paid an amount \\nequal to the number of New Anova Shares which would have been issued to that \\nshareholder divided by the total number of New Anova Shares issued to the Sale Agent.  \\n\\nAny brokerage fees paid by the Sale Agent in respect of the sale of the New Anova Shares \\nissued to the Sale Agent that would otherwise have been issued to Ineligible Foreign \\nShareholders and Electing Small Shareholders will be deducted from the sale proceeds \\npayable to Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders.  Other selling \\ncosts, taxes and charges will also be deducted from the proceeds payable to Ineligible \\nForeign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders. \\n\\nExterra, Anova and the Sale Agent give no assurance as to the price that will be achieved for \\nthe sale of New Anova Shares described above.  The proceeds that Ineligible Foreign \\nShareholders and Electing Small Shareholders will be paid may be more or less than the \\ncurrent market value of Anova Shares. \\n\\nThe sale of the New Anova Shares by the Sale Agent may result in a number of New Anova \\nShares being offered for sale at the same time.  Although the number of New Anova Shares \\nto be sold is not expected to be material, this may have the effect of depressing the sale \\nprice of Anova Shares. \\n\\nThe proceeds of the sale of the New Anova Shares will be paid to each relevant Ineligible \\nForeign Shareholder and Electing Shareholder either by sending a cheque by prepaid post \\nto that shareholder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s registered address as at the Record Date or by making a deposit into \\nan account with an Australian bank nominated by that shareholder to Exterra or the Exterra \\nRegistry at the Record Date. \\n\\nUnder the Scheme, Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders appoint \\nExterra as their agent to receive on their behalf any financial services guide or other notice \\ngiven by the Sale Agent. Copies of any documents received by Exterra from the Sale Agent \\nas agent for the Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and Electing Small Shareholders will be \\nmade available on request to Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s company secretary.  \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 19 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\n2.14 \\n\\nTreatment of Exterra Options \\nUnder the Merger Implementation Agreement, Exterra and Anova agreed to use their \\nreasonable endeavours to procure that each Exterra Optionholder enter into an agreement \\nfor the cancellation of their Exterra Options in exchange for the grant of Anova Options at a \\nratio of one Anova Option for every two Exterra Options held.  \\n\\nThe cancellation of Exterra Options and issue of Anova Options is subject to the Scheme \\nbecoming Effective and is to take effect on the Implementation Date. Further details of the \\ncancellation of the Exterra Options, and Anova Options to be issued to Exterra \\nOptionholders, are set out in Section 10.7. \\n\\nExterra has obtained a waiver from ASX to permit the Exterra Options to be cancelled for \\nconsideration without requiring separate Exterra Shareholder approval. \\n\\n \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 20 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n3 \\nQuestion \\n\\nFrequently asked questions \\n\\nAnswer \\n\\nFurther information \\n\\nGeneral questions \\n\\nWhat are \\nExterra \\nShareholders \\nbeing asked to \\nconsider? \\n\\nOn 8 June 2017, Exterra and Anova announced a proposal to \\nmerge.  The Merger will be implemented by way of scheme of \\narrangement between Exterra and Exterra Shareholders.  If \\nthe Merger is implemented, Exterra Shareholders will own \\napproximately 27.6% of the Merged Group. \\n\\n \\n\\nSection 2.1 \\n\\nWhat \\nconsideration \\nwill I receive? \\n\\nExterra Shareholders (other than Ineligible Foreign \\nShareholders and Electing Small Shareholders) will receive \\none New Anova Share for every two Exterra Shares they own \\nat the Record Date.  \\n\\nSection 2.2 \\n\\nWhat if I am a \\nforeign \\nShareholder? \\n\\nExterra Shareholders with registered addresses outside \\nAustralia and its external territories, New Zealand and Hong \\nKong will not be issued with New Anova Shares.  Instead, the \\nNew Anova Shares that would otherwise have been issued to \\nthem will be sold via a sale facility and they will receive the net \\nsale proceeds. \\n\\nSections 2.11 and 2.13 \\n\\nWhat if I am a \\nSmall \\nShareholder? \\n\\nExterra Shareholders who are entitled to receive 4,000 or less \\nNew Anova Shares under the Scheme may elect to have \\nthose New Anova Shares sold via a sale facility and receive \\nthe net sale cash proceeds instead. \\n\\nSections 2.12 and 2.13 \\n\\nWill I have to \\npay brokerage \\nfees or stamp \\nduty in respect \\nof Scheme \\nConsideration? \\n\\nNo brokerage or stamp duty will be payable by Scheme \\nShareholders on the transfer of their Scheme Shares to \\nAnova under the Scheme or the issue by Anova to them of the \\nNew Anova Shares as the Scheme Consideration. \\nBrokerage fees will however be incurred by Ineligible Foreign \\nShareholders and Electing Small Shareholders. \\n\\nSections 2.9, 2.11, 2.12 and 2.13 \\n\\nCan I sell my \\nExterra Shares \\non the ASX? \\n\\n \\n\\nYou can sell your Exterra Shares on the ASX prior to (and on) \\nthe Effective Date.  However, you will not be able to do so \\nafter the Effective Date.   \\nIf you sell your Exterra Shares on the ASX: \\nyou may pay brokerage on the sale; \\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\nyou will not share in any potential ongoing benefits of \\nowning shares in the Merged Group; and  \\nthere may be different tax consequences for you \\ncompared to those that would arise under the \\nimplementation of the Merger. \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nWill I be able to \\ntrade the New \\nAnova Shares \\non the ASX? \\n\\nAnova Shares (ASX: AWV) currently trade on the ASX, and \\nthe New Anova Shares will trade on the ASX if the Merger is \\nimplemented.  It is expected that you will be able to trade the \\nNew Anova Shares on a deferred settlement basis \\ncommencing on the Business Day after the Effective Date.  It \\nis expected that the New Anova Shares will trade on an \\nordinary settlement basis (T+2) from the Business Day \\nfollowing the Implementation Date. \\n\\nSection 9.16 \\n\\nWhat are the \\n\\nThe transfer of your Exterra Shares pursuant to the Scheme \\n\\nSection 8 \\n\\n \\n\\npage 21 \\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nQuestion \\n\\nAnswer \\n\\nFurther information \\n\\ntax \\nimplications of \\nthe \\ntransaction? \\n\\nmay be a taxable transaction for you.

Anova Metals Limited (ASX: AWV) is a gold company focused \\n\\non re-commencing mining operations at its 100% owned Big \\nSprings Gold Project in north eastern Nevada, USA.  \\n\\nWhat is the \\nScheme? \\n\\nThe Scheme is a scheme of arrangement between Exterra \\nand Exterra Shareholders at the Record Date.  A scheme of \\narrangement is a statutory procedure that is commonly used \\nto enable one company to acquire another company. \\nThe Scheme will effect the merger of Exterra and Anova. \\nIf the Scheme is approved and implemented, Exterra \\nShareholders (other than Ineligible Foreign Shareholders and \\nElecting Small Shareholders) will receive one New Anova \\nShare for every two Exterra Shares they hold as at the Record \\nDate. \\n\\n \\n\\nSection 5 \\n\\nSection 2 \\n\\nEffecting the transaction via the Scheme is believed to be the \\nmost efficient structure to implement the Merger and also \\nreflects the co-operative nature of the Merger. \\n\\n \\n\\nWhy has the \\ntransaction \\nbeen \\nstructured as a \\nscheme of \\narrangement? \\n\\nl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\npage 22 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\nQuestion \\n\\nAnswer \\n\\nFurther information \\n\\nWhat is the \\ntimetable of \\nthe \\ntransaction? \\n\\nThe Scheme Meeting is currently scheduled to be held on 15 \\nSeptember 2017.

The Second Fortune Gold Mine is part of the Linden Gold Project and was \\noriginally mined from 1941 to 1988.  \\n\\nExterra acquired the Linden Gold Project from Haoma Mining NL in 2009 and the project \\nformed part of Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s primary undertaking at the time that the company listed on ASX in \\n2011. \\n\\nUnder Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ownership, the Linden Gold Project is well advanced and the Second \\nFortune Gold Mine has received all material regulatory approvals required to enable mine \\ndevelopment to commence. Subject to completion of key development milestones \\nsummarised below, first gold production is targeted for the first quarter of 2018 from the \\nSecond Fortune Gold Mine.  \\n\\nFeasibility Study and development status \\nThe results of the Feasibility Study on the Linden Gold Project were announced on 25 May \\n2017.  \\n\\nThe Feasibility Study concluded that the Second Fortune Gold Mine is financially and \\ntechnically viable based on developing a mine below the existing open pit and generating a \\nsorted concentrate for toll treating. The Feasibility Study proposes the ore would be trucked \\nto the Lakewood Plant located approximately five kilometres south-east of Kalgoorlie.  \\n\\nThe Linden Gold Project scope includes the development of a high-grade underground mine \\nand processing infrastructure to produce sorted ore concentrates.  A new portal and decline \\nwill provide access to the proposed mine. The development strategy includes the use of ore \\nsorting technology to pre-concentrate ore in a process where dilution and low-grade material \\nare rejected post mining and before haulage and processing in a conventional carbon in \\nleach toll treatment facility. Surface infrastructure includes mining workshops, a power plant, \\nmine camp, and evaporation ponds.  \\n\\nThe development phase and sorting proof of concept, including installation and operation of \\nsurface sorting plant, evaporation ponds and camp refurbishment plant was completed in \\nMay 2017.  \\n\\nAccordingly, the key outstanding phases required to bring the Second Fortune Gold Mine \\nthrough to production comprise:   \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nConstruction phase including completion of mining surface infrastructure \\n(workshop, power, changehouses) and camp expansion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 planned to commence in \\nSeptember 2017.  \\n\\nMining phase including portal and decline development, production \\ncommencement, ramp-up and steady stage operations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 planned to commence in \\nthe last quarter of 2017.  \\n\\nThe Feasibility Study assumes that the Second Fortune Gold Mine has a life of mine \\nproduction target of 392kt grading 5.8g/t Au for approximately 73koz of gold, resulting in \\n67,351 oz of gold recovered.   \\n\\npage 28 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nThe Feasibility Study estimated that $9.4 million ($7.2 million capital costs and $2.2 million \\nworking capital) in funding is required to develop the Second Fortune Gold Mine, with an \\nadditional $3 million working capital contingency to be provisioned to mitigate operational \\nrisk.  \\n\\nThe 2-year life of mine is based upon Probable Ore Reserves (which comprises of that \\nportion of the Indicated Mineral Resources that is able to be converted into an Ore Reserve) \\n(88.7%) and Inferred Mineral Resources (11.3%). Exploration programmes at the Linden \\nGold Project area are continuing, which are aimed at expanding the current 131koz Mineral \\nResource. These are further detailed below.  \\n\\nFurther details regarding the Second Fortune Gold Mine are set out in the Independent \\nExpert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Report contained in Annexure A to this Scheme Booklet. \\n\\nOre Reserves and Mineral Resource \\nBased on reverse circulation and diamond drilling by Exterra and previous operators, Exterra \\nhas outlined a Second Fortune Ore Reserve (Probable, Main Lode only) of 64,941 ounces of \\ngold at an average grade of 6.0 g/t Au and a Mineral Resource (Indicated and Inferred, all \\nlodes) of 130,600 ounces of gold at an average grade of 8.3 g/t Au.  \\nSecond Fortune Main Lode Ore Reserve  \\n\\n \\n \\n\\nGrade \\n\\n \\n\\nProved Ore Reserve \\nAu g/t \\n\\nTonnes (t) \\n\\n- \\n\\nAu (oz) \\n\\n- \\n \\n \\n \\n\\nMetal \\n \\nNotes: Refer to Feasibility Study, ASX announcement dated 25 May 2017.   \\nSecond Fortune Mineral Resource  \\n\\n- \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nAu (oz) \\n64,941 \\n\\nProbable Ore Reserve \\nAu g/t \\n5.96 \\n\\nTonnes (t) \\n338,999 \\n\\nTotal Proved + Probable \\n\\nOre Reserve \\n\\nTonnes (t) \\n338,999 \\n\\nAu g/t \\n5.56 \\n\\nAu (oz) \\n64,941 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\nLode \\n\\n \\n\\nMain \\nLode \\nHanging\\n\\nwall \\n\\nFootwall \\nWest  \\nTotal \\n\\nTonnes \\n\\n211,800 \\n\\n- \\n\\n18,500 \\n4,200 \\n234,500 \\n\\nIndicated \\n\\nGrade \\ng/t Au \\n\\nOunces \\n\\nInferred \\nTonnes  Grade \\ng/t Au \\n\\nTotal \\nOunces  Tonnes  Grade \\ng/tAu \\n\\n9.8 \\n\\n- \\n\\n8.9 \\n4.2 \\n9.6 \\n\\n66,700 \\n\\n35,400 \\n\\n- \\n\\n5,400 \\n600 \\n\\n72,700 \\n\\n58,200 \\n\\n52,900 \\n107,200 \\n253,700 \\n\\n8.0 \\n\\n8.2 \\n\\n7.4 \\n6.1 \\n7.1 \\n\\n9,100 \\n\\n247,200 \\n\\n15,300 \\n\\n58,200 \\n\\n12,500 \\n21,000 \\n57,900 \\n\\n71,400 \\n111,400 \\n488,200 \\n\\n9.6 \\n\\n8.2 \\n\\n7.8 \\n6.0 \\n8.3 \\n\\nOunce\\n\\ns \\n\\n75,800 \\n\\n15,300 \\n\\n17,900 \\n21,600 \\n130,600 \\n\\nNotes: \\n\\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\n\\nIn respect of Second Fortune Main Lode Mineral Resource refer to Exterra ASX announcements dated 25 May \\n2017.  \\nIn respect of Second Fortune Minor Lodes Mineral Resource (which includes, Hangingwall, Footwall and West) \\nrefer to Exterra ASX announcement dated 6 August 2012.  \\nThe Second Fortune Minor Lode Mineral Resources information (which includes, Hangingwall, Footwall and \\nWest) was prepared under the JORC Code 2004 and reported by Exterra.

The project contains the historic underground gold mines Richmond \\nGem and North Star.   \\n\\nExterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mineral Resource estimate for the Malcolm Project is set out in the table below. \\nExterra plans to review the current Malcolm Project data with a view to outlining an \\nexploration drilling programme that seeks to confirm and extend the Mineral Resource base. \\n\\nGrass Flat Gold Project \\nThe Grass Flat Gold Project is 100% owned by Exterra and is located in the Marda-Diemals \\nGreenstone Belt, approximately 150km north of Southern Cross in Western Australia. The \\nproject area includes the historic Halley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s East open pit mine, from which approximately \\n18,000 ozs of gold was produced in 2013 to 2016.   \\n\\nA data review by Exterra in 2017 highlighted the potential for near surface high grade Gold, \\nVolcanogenic Massive Sulphide (VMS) Cu-Pb-Zn-Ag-Au and Hematite Iron Ore potential \\nwithin the project area.  \\n\\nData review is currently in progress to plan on-going exploration with a focus on the gold \\npotential of the Grass Flat project. \\n\\nBar Twenty Project (farm-in and joint venture) \\nAs announced on 4 July 2017, Exterra has recently entered into a farm-in and joint venture \\nagreement with Bar Twenty Pty Ltd over the Bar Twenty Gold Project located approximately \\n20km west northwest of the Second Fortune Gold Mine. Under the terms of the farm-in \\narrangements, Exterra can earn a 75% interest in the project by producing 5,000 ounces of \\ngold from the project.  During the farm-in period, Exterra is entitled to receive 25% of the net \\nprofits from mining on the project. On the commencement of the joint venture, Exterra and \\nBar Twenty Pty Ltd must contribute to all ongoing expenditure on a 75/25 pro rata basis \\n(subject to Bar Twenty\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to elect to a limited carry arrangement or convert its joint \\nventure interest into a right to receive a 2.5% net smelter return royalty in relation to gold \\nproduced from the project).  \\n\\nUnder the Bar Twenty joint venture agreement, Exterra has a right of first refusal to enter into \\nan agreement with Bar Twenty Pty Ltd over a further 7 gold prospects consisting of 8 \\nprospecting licences and 3 exploration licences, all located within 30km of the Second \\nFortune Gold Mine. \\n\\nThe Bar Twenty project development is expected to be run in parallel with the development \\nof the Second Fortune Gold Mine, and has the potential to generate a secondary source of \\nore to add to the planned production from the Second Fortune Gold Mine.  \\n\\nReverse circulation drilling is planned to commence early in July 2017, the results of which, \\nwill be combined with the current data available, will be used to generate a Mineral Resource \\nestimate which will form the basis of economic studies to determine the potential for mine \\ndevelopment. Ongoing project development work will focus on a potential mining operation \\npermitted under the existing approval of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMining Proposal for a Small Operation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\n\\npage 31 \\n\\n\\x0cl\\n\\ny\\nn\\no\\n\\n \\n\\ne\\ns\\nu\\n\\n \\nl\\n\\na\\nn\\no\\ns\\nr\\ne\\np\\n\\n \\nr\\no\\nF\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nZelica1, 2 \\n \\nMalcolm 1, 3 \\n \\n\\nOther Project Mineral Resources \\n  Project \\n \\n\\nIndicated \\nTonnes  Grade \\ng/t Au \\n\\nInferred \\nOunces  Tonnes  Grade \\ng/t Au \\n\\n358,200 \\n\\n1.7 \\n\\n19,000 \\n\\n212,600 \\n\\n1.6 \\n\\nTotal \\nOunces  Tonnes  Grade \\ng/tAu \\n1.6 \\n\\n570,800 \\n\\n11,000 \\n\\nOunces \\n\\n30,000 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n142,200 \\n\\n8.3 \\n\\n37,900 \\n\\n142,200 \\n\\n8.3 \\n\\n37,900 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nNotes: \\n1 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3 \\n\\nThe  information  in  this  table  was  prepared  and  first  disclosed  under  JORC  Code  2004  and  has  not  been \\nupdated to comply with JORC Code 2012 on the basis that the information has not materially changed since it \\nwas last reported. \\nRefer to Exterra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ASX Announcement titled \\xe2\\x80\\x98Quarterly Activities and Cashflow Report\\xe2\\x80\\x99 dated 30 July 2012 for \\nfurther information in relation to the Zelica Mineral Resource estimate.
